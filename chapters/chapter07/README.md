# More functional patterns

## Directions

* [Table of Contents](../../README.md)
* Solutions availables [here](exercises/README.md).

## Make it func-y

* Like variables, functions can be bound to names. Like literals, they can be passed **[anonymously](#anonmyous-functions)**. Languages that treatment of functions no differently from variables are said to treat functions as ["first-class citizens"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function)
* We can perform **[pattern matching](#pattern-matching)** against both variables and functions.
* We can define functions that consume other functions or produce functions as a result.
* We can partially apply functions to yield other functions
* We can compose functions in a manner closely related to the [mathematical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition).
